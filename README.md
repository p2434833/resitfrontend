The website that i have created is a user friendly made about dogs./ In this website you will find information about dogs. I have created a webiste with 4 page (4 tabs, the webiste has been created in HTML 5 adn css3). It contains javascriotp validation and interadction. The main target will be people who have a pet at home more specificly people who have a dog at home about RIOT before or heard about their games or prodcut (ArcaneTVShow). Js has been used and implemented for moving objects.

If there are any parts of your code or user interface that need further explanation, you can include that here.
If anything is broken or doesn't quite work properly, you may explain what it SHOULD do.

You **must** include references (including links) to any external resources/videos/code examples that you have used here.
